Whether you're a movie enthusiast or a creative photographer, this app offers an innovative blend of classic photo editing tools and exclusive film-inspired features tailored to elevate your visual storytelling.

## Key Features

### Standard Photo Editing Tools
MovieFilter starts with the essentials of a robust photo editor, providing you with intuitive options to:
- **Crop** your images to focus on the perfect frame.
- **Rotate** and adjust angles for the ideal composition.
- **Adjust brightness, contrast, and saturation** to fine-tune your photo's mood.

These tools lay the foundation, but the true magic lies in our specialized film-inspired filters, designed to transport your photos to the silver screen.

### Cinematic Filter Options
MovieFilter stands out with its unique filter studios, offering three distinct ways to apply the essence of cinema to your images:

1. **Curated Film-Inspired Filter Set**  
   Dive into a handcrafted collection of filters inspired by iconic movies, meticulously designed by the developer. Each filter captures the distinctive color palettes, lighting, and tones of beloved films—think the warm sepia of classic Westerns, the cool blues of sci-fi epics, or the vibrant hues of modern blockbusters. Simply select a filter, apply it to your photo, and watch as it transforms into a scene straight out of the director's vision.

2. **Gradient Filter Studio**  
   Unleash your creativity with the Gradient Filter Studio, where you can craft your own custom gradient filters. Adjust the color transitions, opacity, and direction to match the mood you’re aiming for—whether it’s a dramatic sunset fade or a subtle vintage wash. This feature empowers you to personalize your photos with a professional touch, making each edit a unique work of art.

3. **AI-Powered Image-Based Filter Generation**  
   Experience cutting-edge technology with our intelligent filter generation studio. Upload any image—be it a movie still, a painting, or a personal photo—and let our smart algorithm analyze its colors, contrasts, and textures. The app then generates a custom filter tailored to that image, allowing you to apply a one-of-a-kind effect to your photos. This innovative tool bridges the gap between inspiration and creation, offering endless possibilities.
